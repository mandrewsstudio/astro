    <p>
      Purpose Disruptors act as a guide and a pathfinder for the advertising industry, showing
      agencies the way towards a sustainable future. The logo symbol — two shapes representing "PD" —
      can be broken up, repeated, shuffled and cropped in to as a spotlight device, both shining a
      light and rearranging the landscape in their movement and dynamism.

  <WorkPara subtitle="Authoritative and Inspiring">
    <p>
      At its core, the brand allows Purpose Disruptors to lay out the facts in simple
      black-and-white, with an emphasis on clarity. But it can also be expressive and imaginative.
      Rather than a wide-ranging colour-palette, we created these vivid background images, derived
      from macro shots of nature, amped up and accelerated into hyperreality.
    </p>
    <p>
      These trippy images can be used to bring colour and vibrancy to layouts, and they tie back to 
      the connection to nature which is so key to Purpose Disruptors' approach.

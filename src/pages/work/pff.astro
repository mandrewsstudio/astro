<WorkLayout title="Parents for Future UK">
  <WorkPara title="A growing movement of grown-ups.">
    <p class="case-intro">
      Parents for Future is for all parents, not just activists.
    </p>
    <p class="case-intro">
      Their brand is an invitation to other parents to join the movement, and a message to those
      in power. Bold typography and a broad colour palette creates unexpected combinations,
      helping PFF communicate a spectrum of emotions from sober and urgent to joyful and
      celebratory.

Parents for Future is for all parents, not just activists.

Their brand is an invitation to other parents to join the movement, and a message to those in power. Bold typography and a broad colour palette creates unexpected combinations, helping PFF communicate a spectrum of emotions from sober and urgent to joyful and celebratory.

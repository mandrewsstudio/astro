title: A modernist twist
---
Inspired by the transport revolution of the 50s and 60s, our goal was to bring the modernism of the mid-century to a new generation of EVs.

The energetic final identity pushed aside stereotypical 'eco' imagery and colour palettes, instead opting for a set of colourful icons which represented London's busy streets and could be used in motion. This also drew a helpful distinction between our campaign and that of corporate entities looking to profit from electrified transport without sharing the benefits with Londoners.

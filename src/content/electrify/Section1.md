Electrify London envisions a city with decarbonised transport, quiet streets and clean air. The campaign was launched by [Clean Cities](https://cleancitiescampaign.org/) at a pivotal point before the 2026 local elections, where more than 1,800 councillors and five Mayors will be elected and given responsibility for 95% of the roads in London.

To secure public support and manifesto commitments pushing forward the electrification of road transport, the campaign needed an identity ready to reach businesses, political changemakers and everyday Londoners alike.

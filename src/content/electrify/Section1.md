Electrify London envisions a city with decarbonised transport, quiet streets and clean air. The campaign was launched by [Clean Cities](https://cleancitiescampaign.org/) at a pivotal point before the 2026 elections, where more than 1,800 councillors and five Mayors will be elected and given responsibility for 95% of the roads in London.

To secure public support and manifesto commitments pushing forward the electrification of road transport, the campaign needed an identity ready to reach businesses, political changemakers and everyday Londoners alike.

Could London's streets be quieter? Less polluted? More efficient?

We want London to become a leading city for electrified transport options, with widespread use of e-cargo bikes, electric car clubs, and electric vans and quadricycles, leading to cleaner air and lower carbon emissions.

In May 2026, This is a pivotal moment to secure manifesto commitments that drive forward the electrification of road transport.

We’ll be organising events, putting out research, communicating with decision makers and the public, and doing everything in partnership

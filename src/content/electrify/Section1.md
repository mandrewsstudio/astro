Our Kids' Climate is a global family of parent-led groups working to
protect children from climate breakdown.

Their new brand positions Our Kids' Climate as a broad movement that
welcomes parents, families and communities from across the world, and
allows them to more effectively champion their member leaders and amplify
their influence on lawmakers and government institutions.

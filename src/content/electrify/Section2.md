title: A boost of energy
---
In our early workshops with the Electrify London team, we identified a key challenge the campaign had to overcome: lethargy. In a time of increasing political polarisation and denial of the impacts of climate change, the campaign needed to beat inaction and mobilise people who get things done.

Inspired by the optimism of modernist design, with its bright colour palettes, simple geometry and bold typography, we played on the power of electricity to bring a feeling of energy and buzz to the brand.

title: Boosting energy
---
In our early workshops with the Electrify London team, we identified a key challenge the campaign had to overcome: lethargy. In a time of increasing political polarisation and denial of the impacts of climate change, the campaign needed to beat inaction and mobilise people who get things done.

Inspired by the transport revolution of the 50s and 60s, our goal was to bring the modernism of the mid-century to a new generation of EVs.

*   We aimed to communicate both joy and practicality in the final identity,
    
*   Steering away from campaigns run by private corporations
    
*   Runs the risk of looking boring
    
*   Moving away from dark greens and blues
    
*   Embracing colour
    
*   Somewhere between the two poles of joy and ambition - not boring
    
*   Don't want to use typical 'eco' imagery like leaves, want to evoke the feeling of the city after the campaign has succeeded. Energy, forward momentum, positive change.

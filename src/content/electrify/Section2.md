title: A boost of energy
---
In our early workshops with the Electrify London team, we identified a key challenge the campaign had to overcome: lethargy. In a time of increasing political polarisation and denial of the impacts of climate change, the campaign needed to beat inaction and mobilise people who get things done.

To bring a feeling of energy and buzz in to the brand, we played on the actual power of electricity that the campaign promotes as well as the optimism of modernist design, with its bright and playful colour palettes and bold typography.

title: An energy boost
---
The most compelling image which came from our early workshops with the Electrify London team was that of a city with freedom to move and breathe. We wanted the campaign to feel like an antidote to lethargy, a rallying cry to the kinds of people who advocate for their communities and get stuff done.

Steering away from your typical 'eco' imagery of leaves and recycling symbols

Drawing a distinction between our campaign and that of corporate entities looking to profit from electrified transport without sharing the benefits with Londoners.

Steering away from campaigns run by private corporations  
Runs the risk of looking boring  
Moving away from dark greens and blues  
Embracing colour  
Somewhere between the two poles of joy and ambition - not boring  
Don't want to use typical 'eco' imagery like leaves, want to evoke the feeling of the city after the campaign has succeeded. Energy, forward momentum, positive change.

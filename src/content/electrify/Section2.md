title: An energy boost
---
In our early workshops with the Electrify London team, we identified a key challenge the campaign had to overcome: lethargy. In a time of increasing political polarisation and denial of the impacts of climate change, the campaign needed to beat apathy/inaction/inertia and mobilise people who get things done.

The energetic final identity pushed aside stereotypical 'eco' imagery and colour palettes, instead opting for a set of colourful icons which represented London's busy streets and could be used in motion. This also drew a helpful distinction between our campaign and that of corporate entities looking to profit from electrified transport without sharing the benefits with Londoners.

We aimed to communicate both joy and practicality in the final identity,

Steering away from campaigns run by private corporations  
Runs the risk of looking boring  
Moving away from dark greens and blues  
Embracing colour  
Somewhere between the two poles of joy and ambition - not boring  
Don't want to use typical 'eco' imagery like leaves, want to evoke the feeling of the city after the campaign has succeeded. Energy, forward momentum, positive change.

title: The Logo
---
We're particularly proud of this one. A logo that illustrates what's at the heart of the organisation: our kids. We knew we wanted an iconic symbol that could defy translation, and show the love, care and joy intrinsic to the movement.

When we realised the letters 'OKC', rotated 90°, resembled a child leaping over a horizon, we knew this had to be the logo.

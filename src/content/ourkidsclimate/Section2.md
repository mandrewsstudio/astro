title: Care, Louder
---
Through our workshops with the OKC team, we discovered an essential tension at the heart of the brand that needs to be communicated. Collaborative sessions with members across the globe — including Brazil, Australia, UK, Kenya, Poland, USA, Canada, and more — helped us understand what drives this passionate group of activists and organisers.

Being a movement made of parents and families, the concept of care runs through the whole network. But care isn't always soft. Care is community, support, empathy — yes — but also advocacy, solidarity and political pressure. From the beginning we established that the brand needs to carve out a space that is both inviting and inspiring, warm and fierce, joyful and forceful.

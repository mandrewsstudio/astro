title: The Power of Parents
---
When it comes to a tagline, it pays to be direct. A simple statement of what we stand for — what we believe in, what we are protecting, what we exist to amplify — the Power of Parents.

We also wanted to expand the definition, to include all parts of the global family, from the father- and mother- figures that aren't related by blood, to those in the family and wider community that play a pivotal role in nurturing and protecting the next generation.

<p>Our Kids’ Climate is a global family of parent-led groups working to protect children from climate breakdown.</p>
<p>Their new brand positions Our Kids’ Climate as a broad movement that welcomes parents, families and communities from across the world, and allows them to more effectively champion their member leaders and amplify their influence on lawmakers and government institutions.</p>

<h3 id="care-louder">Care, Louder</h3>
<p>Through our workshops with the OKC team, we discovered an essential tension at the heart of the brand that needs to be communicated. Collaborative sessions with members across the globe — including Brazil, Australia, UK, Kenya, Poland, USA, Canada, and more — helped us understand what drives this passionate group of activists and organisers.</p>
<p>Being a movement made of parents and families, the concept of care runs through the whole network. But care isn’t always soft. Care is community, support, empathy — yes — but also advocacy, solidarity and political pressure. From the beginning we established that the brand needs to carve out a space that is both inviting and inspiring, warm and fierce, joyful and forceful.</p>

<h3 id="the-logo">The Logo</h3>
<p>We’re particularly proud of this one. A logo that illustrates what’s at the heart of the organisation: our kids. We knew we wanted an iconic symbol that could defy translation, and show the love, care and joy intrinsic to the movement.</p>
<p>When we realised the letters ‘OKC’, rotated 90°, resembled a child leaping over a horizon, we knew this had to be the logo.</p>

<p>When it comes to a tagline, it pays to be direct. A simple statement of what we stand for — what we believe in, what we are protecting, what we exist to amplify — the Power of Parents.</p>
<p>We also wanted to expand the definition, to include all parts of the global family, from the father- and mother- figures that aren’t related by blood, to those in the family and wider community that play a pivotal role in nurturing and protecting the next generation.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of a brand is that people need to be able to use it! The Our Kids’ Climate brand is a kit of parts that come together to form a vibrant, impactful whole.</p>
<p>The toolkit includes a bright, distinctive colour palette, a bold, clear and characterful brand font (Muoto by 205tf), and a range of textures and patterns that can be used to dial the volume of communications up and down.</p>
<p>As always, we brought all these elements together, along with plenty of guidance and inspiration, into an online brand guideline document and a range of editable templates for things like presentations and social posts. The result is a brand that can speak loudly and clearly, with joy and with urgency, and help realise the potential of parents and families and their capacity to change the world.</p>
